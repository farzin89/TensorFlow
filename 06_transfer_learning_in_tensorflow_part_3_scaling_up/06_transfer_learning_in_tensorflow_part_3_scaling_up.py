# Transfer Learning with TensorFlow part3: Scaling up (Food Vision mini)

We've seen the power of transfer learning feature extraction and fine-tuning, now it's time to scale up to all of the classes in food101(101 total classes of food).

Our goal is to beat the original Food101 paper Food101 paper with 10% of the training (leveraging the power of deep learing)

original Food101 paper : https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/static/bossard_eccv14_food-101.pdf

our baseline to beat is 50.76% accuracy across 101 classes.

our goal is to beat the original Food101 paper with 10% of the training data,so let's download it.

the data we'ar dowloading comes from the original Food101 dataset but has been preprocessed using the image_data_modificatio notebook - https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/extras/image_data_modification.ipynb
