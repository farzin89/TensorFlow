# TensorFlow

## 3 steps in modelling with TensorFlow
1. **Creating a model** - define the input and output layers , as well as the hidden layers of a deep learning model.
2. **Compiling a model** - define the loss function (in others words,the function which tells our model how wrong it is) and the optimizer (tells our model how to improve the patterns its learning ) and evaluation metrics(what we can use to interpret the performance of our model).
3. **Fitting the a model** - learning the model try to find patterns between x & y (features and labels).
