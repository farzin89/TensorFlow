# Teansfer learning with TensorFlow part 2 : Fine-tuning 

In the previous notebook, we covered transfer learning feature extraction, now it's time to learn about a new kind of transfer learning: fine-tuning.

"""## Creating helper function 

in previous notebook we've created a bunch of helper function, now we could rewrite them all, however, this is tedious.

So, it's a good idea to put functions you'll want to use again in a script you can download and import into your notebooks (or elsewhere)

we've done this for same of the functions we've used previously here:

"""**Note:** If you're running this notebook in Google colab, when it times out colab will delete helper_function.py , so you have to redownload it if you want access to your helper functions.

## Let's get some data 

This time we're going to see how we can use the pretrained models within **tf.keras.applications** and apply them to our own problem (recognizing imsges of food).
